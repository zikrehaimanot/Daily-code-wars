## Things Learned:

For Tuesday's code-war I was reminded that zero isn't an even number. when the weight was equal to 2 I assumed that the number should return two (because two itself is an even number thus allowing each person to have an equal amount. BUT it was a curveball ! the code needed to be written in  a way that recognized if the weight was below four the program should return false. )
